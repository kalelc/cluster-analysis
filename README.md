# Cluster Analysis with K-Means

## Purpose
This project is a example implementation k-means in ruby with rmagick to  explain the distribution of elements in the clusters.

## Description

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.

## Quick Start

Generate git animate with all iteration to order elements in clusters.

```ruby test.rb````
